# Novel Generator Discord Bot

## Introduction

This Discord bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate a novel based on user-specified preferences. Users can set their preferences for genre, style, summary, and world, and the bot will generate a novel accordingly.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'` and `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` in `bot.py` with your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key.

4. Run the bot:

```
python bot.py
```

The bot should now be running and responding to commands.

## Commands

The bot supports the following commands:

- `$set <key> <value>`: Sets a preference for the user. The `<key>` can be one of the following:
  - `genre`: The genre of the novel.
  - `style`: The writing style of the novel.
  - `summary`: A brief summary of the novel's plot.
  - `world`: A description of the novel's world.
  
  The `<value>` is the desired setting for the given key.

  Example: `$set genre fantasy`

- `$novel`: Generates a novel based on the user's preferences. The bot will send a series of prompts to OpenAI's GPT-3, first describing the world, then introducing the main characters, and finally writing the first chapter of the novel. The generated text will be sent back to the user.

  Example: `$novel`

Please note that these commands need to be executed in a channel where the bot is present.

## Implementation Details

The bot is implemented in Python using the `discord.py` library. User preferences are stored in a dictionary, which is indexed by user ID to allow each user to have their own preferences. The bot uses the OpenAI API to generate the novel, using the user's preferences to craft the prompts.

## Future Work

There are a few potential improvements that could be made to the bot:

- Add error handling to prevent the bot from crashing if a user tries to generate a novel without first setting their preferences.
- Improve the novel generation process by breaking it down into multiple prompts. This could help to produce more consistent and detailed stories.
- Add a graphical interface for setting preferences, either using Discord's new button or slash command features, or by creating a separate web interface.
