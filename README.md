Here is GitHub documentation for the Discord bot code:

# Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot built with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/) to help generate novel content.

## Features

- Set user preferences for genre, style, etc.
- Generate a synopsis based on user preferences
- Generate a chapter outline based on synopsis and user prefs
- Generate chapter beats based on outline and user prefs  
- Generate a full chapter based on beats and user prefs

## Commands

- `$set` - Set a user preference like genre or style
- `$novel` - Generate a full novel based on set prefs
- `$hello` - Simple test command
- `$BrainX` - Set the main character/plot premise
- `$Genre` - Set genre (sci-fi, romance, etc.)  
- `$Style` - Set writing style (concise, descriptive, etc.)
- `$GenerateSynopsis` - Generate a synopsis
- `$GenerateChapterOutline` - Generate a chapter outline
- `$GenerateChapterBeats` - Generate chapter beats 
- `$GenerateChapter` - Generate a full chapter

## BrainX System

1. **BrainX:** The user uses this command to provide free-form input about the overall story idea and context. This data is stored and later used as a part of the prompt when making calls to the OpenAI API. The command could look like this: `$BrainX <free-form story context here>`

2. **Genre:** The user uses this command to specify the genre, tropes, tone, and style of the story. This information is also stored and used in generating the story's synopsis, outlines, and beats. The command could look like this: `$Genre <story genre, tropes, tone, and style here>`

3. **Style:** The user uses this command to specify the tone, word choice, and sentence structure that they want in the story. This information is used when generating the story's beats and prose. The command could look like this: `$Style <tone, word choice, and sentence structure here>`

4. **GenerateSynopsis:** This command generates a synopsis for the story using the data provided by the `BrainX`, `Genre`, and `Style` commands. The command is simply: `$GenerateSynopsis`

5. **GenerateChapterOutline:** This command generates an outline for a chapter based on the synopsis and the genre. The command is: `$GenerateChapterOutline`

6. **GenerateChapterBeats:** This command generates the beats for a chapter based on all the data provided so far. The command is: `$GenerateChapterBeats`

7. **GenerateChapter:** This command generates the full chapter based on the chapter beats. The command is: `$GenerateChapter`

The bot is designed in such a way that each command builds upon the information gathered from the previous commands, hence the sequence of commands is important. The `GenerateSynopsis`, `GenerateChapterOutline`, `GenerateChapterBeats`, and `GenerateChapter` commands use the OpenAI API to generate their outputs based on the data stored from the previous commands. This makes the bot an interactive tool for creating a story in a step-by-step process.

## Configuration

The bot requires a `.env` file with the following:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token 
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

It also uses a `db.json` file to store user preference data.

## Running the Bot

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bot.py
```

The bot will connect to Discord using the provided token.

## Deployment

The bot can be deployed to any service that can run a Python app. Some options:

- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
- [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html) 
- [GCP App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/quickstart)
- [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=linux)

The `.env` file and `db.json` file will need to be configured for the environment.
